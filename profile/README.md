## Repositories

- ...Because GitHub organizations doesn't provide a way to link together related repositories, we prefix related repos (`hardware-`, `software-`, etc)
- `discussions`
  - Development logs, troubleshooting w/ links to references, etc to be formally documented later if needed
- `sketches`
  - Software architecture sketch
  - Development tools/platforms relationship sketch
  - Any other sketches that don't have a particular repository to live in
- `fundamental-engineering-notes`
  - Ryuichi's engineering notes from books, school, and work
- `team-guides`
  - Guides for team members including development rules, micromouse assembly guide, etc
