# Mouse Unit 07 GitHub Organization
All Mouse Unit 07 development related repos, files, etc live here!

The entry point to get to development is:

- **team-rules** document: [team-guides/team-rules](https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/team-guides/blob/main/team-rules/team-rules.md)

- **development tools** document: [engineering-sketches/development-tools](https://github.com/Mouse-Unit-07/engineering-sketches/blob/main/development-tools/development-tools.md)

After reading the above, you'll have a grasp of the entire workbench.
