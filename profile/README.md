# Mouse Unit 07 GitHub Organization

All Mouse Unit 07 development related repos, files, etc live here!

## Projects

  - _Mouse Unit 07 Kanban_

## Repositories

...Because GitHub organizations doesn't provide a way to link together related repositories, we prefix related repos (`hardware-`, `software-`, etc)
- _`discussions`_
  - Development logs, troubleshooting w/ links to references, etc to be formally documented later if needed
- _`sketches`_
  - Software architecture sketches, development tools relationship sketches, and any other sketches that don't have a particular repository to live in
- _`team-guides`_
  - Guides for team members including development rules, micromouse assembly guide, etc
- _`fundamental-engineering-notes`_
  - Ryuichi's engineering notes from books, school, and work
